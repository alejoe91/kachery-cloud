# Creating a Wasabi bucket as part of a Kachery zone

* Create an account and sign to [wasabi.com](https://wasabi.com/)
* Create a new bucket
    - The bucket name is globally unique (for example `kachery-zone-zn1`)
    - Pay attention to the region you choose (I don't think you can modify that later)
    - You can use all default options
* Get access keys
    - Wasabi console home
    - Access keys (left panel)
    - Create new access key
    - Copy the "Access Key" and the "Secret Key" and paste them somewhere temporary and safe. Note that once you close this box, you won't be able to retrieve the secret key ever again, but you can always create a new key pair.
