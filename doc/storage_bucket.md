# Storage buckets

Storage buckets are like file systems in the cloud, but instead of files, buckets store objects. Each Kachery zone has a single storage bucket for storing data files and other information necessary for the functioning of the zone.

## Object storage

Object storage is a type of data storage that is designed for storing large amounts of unstructured data. This data can include things like videos, audio files, images, and other data files. An object storage bucket is a container within an object storage system that is used to hold this data. Objects are added to a bucket, and the bucket is responsible for storing, managing, and organizing the objects within it. Each object is given a unique identifier so that it can be easily retrieved and accessed.
