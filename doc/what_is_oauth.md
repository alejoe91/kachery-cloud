## What is OAuth?

<!-- Used OpenAI -->
OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization on the internet. It allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources (such as data stored on a website) without sharing their passwords. OAuth provides a secure way for users to grant access to their resources without compromising the security of their password or other sensitive information.

<!-- Used OpenAI -->
OAuth uses tokens to grant access to resources, rather than sharing a username and password. This means that the user's credentials are never shared with the third-party application, and the user can easily revoke access to the third-party application if necessary.

<!-- Used OpenAI -->
OAuth is commonly used by websites and applications to allow users to log in using their existing accounts on other websites, such as Google or Facebook. This allows users to access multiple websites and applications using a single set of credentials, which can make it easier and more convenient to use the internet.

<!-- Used OpenAI -->
Overall, OAuth is a secure and convenient way to grant access to resources on the internet without sharing sensitive information.
