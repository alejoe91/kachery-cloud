# What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a popular and powerful open-source database program that is designed for working with large amounts of data. It is classified as a NoSQL database, which means that it does not use the traditional SQL (Structured Query Language) for managing data. Instead, it uses a more flexible and scalable approach that allows for the storage of data in the form of JSON-like documents. This makes MongoDB well-suited for applications that require the ability to store and query large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.
