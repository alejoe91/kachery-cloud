ReCAPTCHA is a service offered by Google that uses advanced risk analysis techniques to protect websites from spam and other types of automated abuse. It can be used to prevent bots from accessing certain parts of a website, such as a login page or a page with sensitive information. Traditionally, when a user visits a website that uses ReCAPTCHA, they will be prompted to complete a challenge to prove that they are a human and not a bot. In the more recent version of the protocol, the user doesn't need to complete any tasks because the system will automatically determine whether the user is human.
