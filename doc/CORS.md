# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows a web page to access resources from a domain other than the one that the page is hosted on. This is important because, by default, web browsers block requests to load resources from other domains for security reasons. However, with CORS, a web page can explicitly allow certain domains to access its resources, enabling cross-domain communication. This can be useful in situations where you want to share data or functionality between different websites.

## Kachery and CORS

Kachery uses CORS configuration on storage buckets to allow figurl.org to access resources from the Kachery zones.
