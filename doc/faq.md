# Frequently asked questions

**How secure is kachery-cloud? Can I keep my data private?**

Kachery-cloud has been created to facilitate open scientific research by making data easily accessible between collaborating labs. With that said, it is not possible (without admin access) to browse the contents of a Kachery zone. Therefore, if somebody doesn't have the hash URI to a file, then in principle, they would not be able to access it, even if the file were otherwise publicly available.

If privacy is a concern, you may want to consider hosting your own Kachery zone and provisioning your own cloud resources. Then you can better control who has access to those resources.

**Is there a cost associated with using kachery-cloud?**

Kachery-cloud is offered as a free service for the purpose of scientific research. It should not be used for other purposes. If a user or a lab wants more control of their data, they can provision their own cloud resources and host their own Kachery zone.
