# Serverless functions

Kachery uses a so-called Serverless Function API to manage the interaction between Kachery clients and the data stored in a Kachery zone. This offers advantages in terms of ease of maintenance, development, and scaling.

## What is the advantage of a Serverless API?

Serverless functions, also known as "serverless computing" or "function as a service (FaaS)," are cloud-based computing services that enable developers to execute code without the need to manage and maintain their own server infrastructure. This means that developers can focus on writing and deploying their code, while the cloud provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and provisioning.

Serverless functions are typically triggered by events, such as a request to an API. These functions are executed on-demand, only when they are needed, and are automatically scaled to handle the workload. This means that users only pay for the computing resources that they use, rather than having to pay for a pre-allocated amount of resources.
